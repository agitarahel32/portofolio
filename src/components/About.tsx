        I am a passionate and motivated Computer Technology (D3) 
        student currently in my 5th semester at Institut Teknologi Del. 
        I have experience in designing, building, 
        and documenting interactive web-based applications with a focus on UI/UX,
        API integration, and system workflows. I enjoy learning new technologies, collaborating in teams,
        and building digital products that provide real value to users.
